              Introduction to AI and ML
            </p>
            <p>
              Building intelligent machines that can carry out tasks that normally require human intelligence is the
              goal of the broad field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI). Though there are many
              different approaches to the multidisciplinary science of artificial intelligence (AI), developments in
              deep learning and machine learning are fundamentally changing almost every area of the IT sector. As a
              subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning is the process of utilising statistical methods to let
              computers "learn" from data and make judgements with little help from humans.
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle">
              Applications and Impact
            </p>
            <p>
              AI and ML have a wide range of applications that are always changing. AI systems in the healthcare
              industry are significantly more capable than humans in processing large amounts of data and identifying
              patterns in it, which helps with early disease identification and personalised treatment. AI powers
              algorithmic trading and risk management in the financial sector, and it powers the algorithms that enable
              self-driving cars in the transportation sector. AI and ML also improve user experiences by making tailored
              recommendations for entertainment and retail. Each of these apps has a significant impact on our daily
              lives by streamlining procedures and enhancing the calibre and customisation of services.

              Challenges and Ethical Considerations
            </p>
            <p>
              Even with all of its promise, AI and ML come with a number of serious drawbacks and moral dilemmas. Jobs
              that are automated bring about socioeconomic changes that need to be carefully managed and workers
              retrained. Bias in AI systems is a concern since algorithms may reinforce and magnify societal biases
              found in the training set. Privacy is a crucial concern as artificial intelligence systems that utilise
              personal data for decision-making may result in invasive monitoring. It is crucial to guarantee the moral
              use of AI and ML, which calls for open procedures, fair data representation, and ongoing supervision.
