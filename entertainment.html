            Introduction to AI and ML
          </p>
          <p>
            Building intelligent machines that can carry out tasks that normally require human intelligence is the
            goal of the broad field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI). Though there are many
            different approaches to the multidisciplinary science of artificial intelligence (AI), developments in
            deep learning and machine learning are fundamentally changing almost every area of the IT sector. As a
            subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning is the process of utilising statistical methods to let
            computers "learn" from data and make judgements with little help from humans.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Applications and Impact
          </p>
          <p>
            AI and ML have a wide range of applications that are always changing. AI systems in the healthcare
            industry are significantly more capable than humans in processing large amounts of data and identifying
            patterns in it, which helps with early disease identification and personalised treatment. AI powers
            algorithmic trading and risk management in the financial sector, and it powers the algorithms that enable
            self-driving cars in the transportation sector. AI and ML also improve user experiences by making tailored
            recommendations for entertainment and retail. Each of these apps has a significant impact on our daily
            lives by streamlining procedures and enhancing the calibre and customisation of services.

          <p class="subtitle">
            Challenges and Ethical Considerations
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with all of its promise, AI and ML come with a number of serious drawbacks and moral dilemmas. Jobs
            that are automated bring about socioeconomic changes that need to be carefully managed and workers
            retrained. Bias in AI systems is a concern since algorithms may reinforce and magnify societal biases
            found in the training set. Privacy is a crucial concern as artificial intelligence systems that utilise
            personal data for decision-making may result in invasive monitoring. It is crucial to guarantee the moral
            use of AI and ML, which calls for open procedures, fair data representation, and ongoing supervision.

            You can walk in a completely different way with the moonwalkers, a unique style of footwear. With its
            wheeled form, you can go faster than you would normally be able to walk on surfaces—almost like sprinting
            but with less impact. The ergonomic hinge mechanism in the shoes helps you propel yourself forward
            effortlessly by maintaining the correct alignment of your feet and ankles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their adaptability is a significant benefit. The big wheels are capable of handling a variety of conditions,
            including rugged paths and smooth ones. They are easy to put on and take off thanks to the quick-release
            buckles. Amazingly, they can be fastened to any type of shoe, so you can enjoy "wheeled running" in your
            preferred shoe
          </p>
          <p>
            Features like hand-free gesture control for navigation and acceleration put safety first. With no
            freewheeling or uncontrolled steps, the business claims you can attain speeds up to 2.5 times faster than
            walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moonwalkers offer an almost magical sensation of swiftly and easily gliding, beyond their physical
            prowess. Combining the advantages of walking and running into one cutting-edge mobility experience, they
            provide an enjoyable and invigorating means of transportation.
